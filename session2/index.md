## Mod 0 Expecations

Mod 0 is less about code or solving difficult problems and more about developing and learning tools, procedures, systems, and  learning behaviors/processes. For some of you, the technical content will be brand new. For others, it will be review. 

At the end of Session 5, you'll take a technical assessment that will showcase a subset skills you learn during Mod 0. The assessment will be performance-based rather than multiple choice. The assessment instructions will include a checklist of what we're looking for to know that you've practiced and mastered the material. 

In addition to the technical assessment, we're also looking for you to demonstrate mastery and/or growth of in the Core Value areas that make students successful at Turing. These include: 

<div class="mod0values">
  <div>

      <li>Fully engage in session material</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Be Focused</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Close or minimize anything else on your computer that might be distracting</li>
      <li>Put phones and other devices away throughout the session </li>
      <li>Take notes during "lecture" portions, type exercises into textboxes, set aside time after session to pick out key concepts from exercises and transfer to notebook</li>
      <li>Complete homework assignments by the start of the next session: practice tasks, readings and responses, and daily habits</li>
      <li>Schedule and manage time to get assignments done</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Be Collaborative</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Volunteer to share answers/ideas using voice, screen, and video</li>
      <li>Be ready for cold-calls</li>
      <li>Ask questions when you don't understand to help yourself and others</li>
      <li>Challenge yourself to speak up in groups, articulate your ideas to peers, and encourage others to share out as well</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Planning your Growth (Break out rooms)</h3>
  <p>1. Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, most unbelievable fact about yourself).</p>
  <p>2. Out of the list above, which 2-3 skills will be your focus for the next week, and how will you improve them? For example, if I want to work on <strong>notetaking</strong> and <strong>participation</strong>, I might share:</p>
  <em>I will label my notes with headings to categorize concepts/topics. After the session, I will take a 10 minute break then come back to the computer and synthesize big ideas from the curriculum into my notebook. I will type questions into the chat box when I don't understand something.</em>
  <p>3. How will you hold yourself accountable?</p>
</div>

Other things to note as we go through Mod 0:

- <strong>Zoom</strong>: turn video on, turn mic off unless speaking
- <strong>Breakout Rooms</strong>: don't be afraid to speak! Breakout rooms will be randomized at the beginning of each session, but continue to rely on your accountabilabuddy groups from Session 1 between sessions
- <strong>Problems or individual questions during the Zoom session?</strong> Message the non-presenting host (either Rachel or Tim)
- <strong>NOTE</strong>: text typed into this page will not save, so don't refresh or close this window until you've reviewed your notes. 

Successful completion of assignments, session engagement, and the Session 5 Technical Assessment will result in a rating of "Turing-Ready." At any point if you feel like you may not meet the expectations, or you need advice/guidance on meeting an expectation, please reach out via Slack to either Rachel, Tim, or Sarah. 

Let's dive in! 

<a name="shortcuts"></a>
## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most computer users rely heavily on the mouse to open applications, interact with programs, etc. You might think that you're quick with a mouse, but just wait until you get good at <span class="vocab">keyboard shortcuts</span>. 

Initially, your flow will be slower as you learn and memorize each of the shortcuts. However, if you force yourself to use these shortcuts, you'll become MUCH faster in the long run.

## Googling

Believe it or not, a good chunk of your time as a programmer will be spent Googling to find answers to your questions. In fact, a somewhat experienced programmer will Google at a much higher rate than a beginning programmer. Therefore, it's really important to get good at Googling. 

For a frame of reference so that you know just how often we rely on Google (even the "easy" stuff), this is my most recent Chrome history as I've been building this curriculum 😂

<img style="width: 50%" src="images/rachel_history.png" alt="Rachel's search history">

When I Google programming questions, I _usually_ include three things (in varying orders): 

<ol>
  <li>What I want to do (verb)</li>
  <li>to what thing (noun)</li>
  <li>using what language or tool</li>
</ol>

For example, if I wanted to add a thick green border to a heading on my webpage and I'm using plain CSS for styling, I might google this:

```
how to add border to heading css
```

or

```
make border on heading element css
```

<div class="things-to-note">
  <h4>Things to Note</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>If the question is generic to programming, replace the name of the langauge with "programming"</li>
    <li>If something is just not working, don't worry about coming up with a "how to" phrase. Instead, you can just google "----- not working". Similarly, use "what is/are" for terminology questions.</li>
    <li>While capitalization doesn't matter, word order does matter. Google will look for results where words are ordered or grouped the same way you had them in your search and prioritize those. For example, you get different results when you search "cheese pizza" compared to "pizza cheese"</li>
    <li><strong>SUPER IMPORTANT:</strong> You might not get the results you're looking for on the first go-around. </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Writing Google-able Phrases</h3>
  <p>Write out Google-able search phrases for each of the following scenarios. Do not get hung up on being unfamiliar with the terminology for each scenario. We just want phrases to put into Google.</p>
  <p>1. I'm building a game using JavaScript and I have an array of six elements. I need to figure out how to get rid of the last three elements in the array.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2:

  <p>2. I am using Git for version control and made a typo in a commit message. I need to change it before I push my changes to GitHub.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">

  <textarea rows="2">

### Sifting Through Results

Once you formulate a good Google search and receive your results, there are a few things you'll want to consider when determining which results to open. 

<ol>
  <li><strong>Posting Date:</strong> Programming languages and best practices change <strong>fast</strong>. Therefore, you want to make sure that you're getting the most up-to-date information. While there is no hard and fast rule for what is considered up-to-date, I generally avoid reading things that were posted more than two years ago. However, even things posted two years ago might be obsolete if you're working with a cutting-edge technology or langauge.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Code:</strong> The best resources generally include example code snippets that you can use to compare to your own code.</li>
  <li><strong>Description/Text:</strong> Along with code snippets, the best results are those that also include a simple description of what the code is doing.</li>
  <li><strong>Publisher:</strong> There are a lot of sites out there that are reputable and some where you'll need to use your best judgement. 
    <small>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="http://ruby-doc.org" title="">ruby-doc.org</a></strong>: While the Ruby Docs are trusted, they can be somewhat difficult for beginners to navigate and understand</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org" title="">developer.mozilla.org</a></strong>: Considered some of the best information for HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://git-scm.com" title="">git-scm.com</a>, <a href="http://help.github.com" title="">help.github.com</a></strong>: Both Git and Github's official documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Official site for a specific tool or language</strong>: Good place to start if you have a question related to a library or framework; however, sometimes you can find a faster answer on a Q&A site.</li>
        <li><strong>Stack Overflow</strong>: Stack Overflow is one of my personal favorite resources for getting unstuck; however, make sure to check that the question is actually the <strong>same question</strong> that you're asking, the answer is not <strong>outdated</strong>, and that the answer is <strong>upvoted</strong> multiple times. In addition, read the comments below the top answer to see if there is any new information or different scenarios that might fit your issue better.</li>
        <li><strong>W3 Schools</strong>: Generally good for very basic questions, but considered behind-the-time and sometimes shows bad practices</li>
        <li><strong>Blog Posts</strong>: As a beginner (and even now!), I found a lot of answers through blog posts and tutorials. Again, watch the <strong>date</strong> on these posts and understand that these posts may or may not reflect best practices. </li>
        <li><strong>Videos</strong>: Video walk-throughs and tutorials are usually pretty great, but they can be time consuming if you're looing for a quick answer. Again, check the date of the post.</li>
      </ul>
    </small>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Sifting Through Results</h3>
  <p>In your breakout rooms, the person with the darkest shirt will share their screen by clicking the green "Share Screen" button. This person will copy one of their search phrases from the last "Try It" section and paste it into Google.</p>
  <p>As a group, review the results list discuss which results you would consider using to solve this problem using the general guidelines above.</p>
  <p>Be ready to share how your group sifted through results.</p>

## BREAK

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body. 

<a name="datatypes"></a>
## Basic Data Types 

In most programming languages, you'll find the same basic <span class="vocab">data types</span>. A data type represents the kind of data that you can use in the programming language. In this section, we'll discuss five different basic data types that are applicable to both the front end and back end. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Basic Data Type Definitions</h3>
  <p>In your breakout groups, discuss and/or use Google to figure out what each of the following data types are used for in programming. Use your notebook to jot down your answer (and examples, if applicable).</p>

  <p>1. <strong>What are <span class="vocab">strings</span> used for in programming?</strong></p>
  <p>2. <strong>What are <span class="vocab">integers</span> and <span class="vocab">floats</span> are used for in programming</strong>?</p>
  <p>3. <strong>What is a <span class="vocab">boolean</span> value used for in programming</strong>?</p>
  <p>4. <strong>What is an <span class="vocab">array</span> used for in programming?</strong></p>
  <p>5. If you're in the front end program, we're going to call the next data type an <span class="vocab">object</span>. If you're in the back end program, we're going to call it a <span class="vocab">hash</span>. <strong>What is this data type used for in programming?</strong></p>
</div>


### Data Type Use Cases and Syntax

Luckily for us, the <span class="vocab">syntax</span> (the way we write) for these basic data typs is almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript. 

Imagine that we're making an application for grocery stores to use (intentionally vague description 😁). For each of the data types we researched, we'll brainstorm examples of how we might use that data type in a grocery store app.

  <div class="toggle-show">
    Integers and Floats Definition (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p><strong><span class="vocab">Integer</span>:</strong> An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>10</code></li>

  <div class="toggle-show">
    Boolean Definition (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p>A <span class="vocab">boolean</span> value is either true or false. Boolean values are used in boolean logic, which is a subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements.</p> 
      <p>As a side note beyond the scope of today's lesson, boolean expressions use the operators AND, OR, and NOT to compare values and return a true or false result. An example of booleans in real life might be:
      </p>
      <p>If <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's raining</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have an appointment</span>, then grab the umbrella.</p>
      <p>This could translate to:</p>

      <p>TRUE and FALSE = FALSE</p>
      <p>FALSE and TRUE = FALSE</p>

  <p>What might you want to store in an array in your shopping app? Start all of your answers with "list of..." </p>
  <div class="toggle-show">
    Array Definition (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p>An <span class="vocab">array</span> is a data structure that represents a group of things.</p> 
      <p>You can think of an array as a collection, box, or container. Instead of saying "I have a collection of shirts," you could say "I have an array of shirts." The phrase "a container of pencils" would become "an array of pencils."</p>
      <p>Typically, elements in an array are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>[26, 24, 28, 25, 27, 27, 26, 27]</code></li>

  <div class="toggle-show">
    Hash/Object Whole Group Review (click here)
    <div class="hidden">
      <p>A <span class="vocab">hash</span> or <span class="vocab">object</span> is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an array in that it is a collection of things, but in the case of hashes/objects, we are <strong>pairing</strong> data together.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, this data type is referred to as a dictionary because of the pairing of word -> definition.</p>
      <p>For example, you might have a hash/object where the keys are first names and the values are last names.</p>
      <p>When I think about whether or not I need to use a hash, I ask myself "Is this a collection of data where the pairing of items matters?"</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <li><code>{ "9th grade": 110, "10th grade": 125, "11th grade": 66, "12th grade": 70}</code></li>

## Iteration

Iteration (or looping for a specified number of times) is a process of repeating a task for each object in a collection. For each of the scenarios below, we'll walk through using props to demonstrate the concept.

### Iteration in Real Life

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>Collection</th>
      <th>For each...</th>
      <th>Do this:</th>
      <th>Then:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Grading papers</td>
      <td>papers</td>
      <td>paper</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>read through it</li>
          <li>mark the score on the top</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next paper</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Feeding animals</td>
      <td>animals</td>
      <td>animal</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>bring the animal to the food bucket</li>
          <li>allow the animal to eat</li>
          <li>bring animal back to barn</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next animal</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

        <ol>
          <li>subtract birth year from 2019 to get age</li>
          <li>subtract age from 220</li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next raw point value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

          <li>capitalize the first letter</li>
          <li>lowercase all remaining letters <br><small><em>Note: this 2nd step, in itself, is iteration!</em></small></li>
        </ol>
      </td>
      <td>repeat with next name</td>
    </tr>

### Iteration Syntax

We'll go into breakout rooms to briefly discuss the syntax for iterating in Ruby and JavaScript. 

<div>
  Are you a <button class="iteration-toggle" id="fe-show">front end</button> or <button class="iteration-toggle" id="be-show">back end</button> student?
  <div class="hidden fe-iteration">
    <p>The code that you see below is written using JavaScript. This syntax is something that you'll see all over the place, so it's important to get used to it. You don't need to memorize every little symbol for now, but knowing how to explain the big pieces is important.</p>
    <h4>Example #1: Grading papers for five students</h4>
    <pre>var students = ['Megan', 'Jose', 'Xavier', 'Ali', 'Miriam'];

for (i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
  console.log('Grading paper for: ' + students[i]);
};</pre>
      <h4>Example #2: Multiplying By Six</h4>
      <pre>var numbers = [7, 18, 23, 38, 41, 57, 65];

for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log('The answer is: ' + numbers[i] * 6);
};</pre>
      <div class="try-it">

## The End!

After this Zoom call is over, take 15 minutes on your own to digest the content from this lesson, including the notes you wrote in the text boxes. 

In addition, consider the following questions:
  - What do I understand from today?
  - When will I need what I just learned? 
  - What questions do I still have? 
  - What learning processes/behaviors did I exercise today?
