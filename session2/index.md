## Mod 0 Expecations

Mod 0 is less about code or solving difficult problems and more about developing and learning tools, procedures, systems, and  learning behaviors/processes. For some of you, the technical content will be brand new. For others, it will be review. 

At the end of Session 5, you'll take a technical assessment that will showcase a subset skills you learn during Mod 0. The assessment will be performance-based rather than multiple choice. The assessment instructions will include a checklist of what we're looking for to know that you've practiced and mastered the material. 

In addition to the technical assessment, we're also looking for you to demonstrate mastery and/or growth of the things that make students successful at Turing. These include: 

- <strong>Attendance</strong>: be on time; stay the whole time; give notice in advance if there's a reason you cannot attend
- <strong>Learning Behaviors</strong>: manage time to get assignments done; notetake effectively in a way that leads to content mastery; full engagement in material; full participation in sessions
- <strong>Notetaking</strong>: hand-write notes during "lecture" portions, type exercises into textboxes, then set aside 15 minutes after the session to digest notes into 
- <strong>Participating and Sharing</strong>: be ready for cold-calls, volunteer to share answers/ideas using voice, screen, and video
- <strong>Homework</strong>: homework is to be completed by the start of the next session and will consist of `practice tasks`, `readings and responses`, and `daily habits`.

Other things to note as we go through Mod 0:

- <strong>Zoom</strong>: turn video on, turn mic off unless speaking
- <strong>Focus</strong>: close or minimize anything else on your computer that might be distracting; put phones and other devices away throughout the session
- <strong>Pop Quizzes</strong>: be ready for short quizzes at the beginning of the sessions that check your understanding of past work
- <strong>Problems or individual questions during the Zoom session?</strong> Message the non-presenting host (either Rachel or Tim)
- <strong>NOTE</strong>: text typed into this page will not save, so don't refresh or close this window until you've reviewed your notes. 

<a name="shortcuts"></a>
## Why Use Shortcuts?

Most computer users rely heavily on the mouse to open applications, interact with programs, etc. You might think that you're quick with a mouse, but just wait until you get good at <span class="vocab">keyboard shortcuts</span>. 

Initially, your flow will be slower as you learn and memorize each of the shortcuts. However, if you force yourself to use these shortcuts, you'll become MUCH faster in the long run. 

<div class="try-it">

## Googling

Believe it or not, a good chunk of your time as a programmer will be spent Googling to find answers to your questions. In fact, a somewhat experienced programmer will Google at a much higher rate than a beginning programmer. Therefore, it's really important to get good at Googling. 

For a frame of reference so that you know just how often we rely on Google (even the "easy" stuff), this is my most recent Chrome history as I've been building this curriculum ðŸ˜‚

<img style="width: 50%" src="images/rachel_history.png" alt="Rachel's search history">

When I Google programming questions, I _usually_ include three things: 

<ol>
  <li>What I want to do (verb)</li>
  <li>to what thing (noun)</li>
  <li>using what language or tool</li>
</ol>

For example, if I wanted to add a thick green border to a heading on my webpage and I'm using plain CSS for styling, I might google this:

```
how to add border to heading css
```


<div class="things-to-note">
  <h4>Things to Note</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>If the question is generic to programming, replace the name of the langauge with "programming"</li>
    <li>If the thing you need to search is a definition (as opposed to how to do something), replace "how to" with "what is"</li>
    <li>While capitalization doesn't matter, word order does. Google will look for results where words are ordered or grouped the same way you had them in your search and prioritize those. For example, you get different results when you search "cheese pizza" compared to "pizza cheese"</li>
    <li><strong>SUPER IMPORTANT:</strong> You might not get the results you're looking for on the first go-around. </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Writing Google-able Phrases</h2>
  <p>Write out <strong>TWO</strong> Google-able search phrases for each of the following scenarios. Do not get hung up on being unfamiliar with the terminology for each scenario. We just want phrases to put into Google.</p>
  <p>I'm making a webpage using HTML and CSS, and my image is pressed right up to the edge of the window. I want some more space on the left side of the image so that it's not touching the browser window.</p>

#### Sifting Through Results

Once you formulate a good Google search and receive your results, there are a few things you'll want to consider when determining which results to open. 

<ol>
  <li><strong>Posting Date:</strong> Programming languages and best practices change <strong>fast</strong>. Therefore, you want to make sure that you're getting the most up-to-date information. While there is no hard and fast rule for what is considered up-to-date, I generally avoid reading things that were posted more than two years ago. However, even things posted two years ago might be obsolete if you're working with a cutting-edge technology or langauge.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Code:</strong> The best resources generally include example code snippets that you can use to compare to your own code.</li>
  <li><strong>Description/Text:</strong> Along with code snippets, the best results are those that also include a simple description of what the code is doing.</li>
  <li><strong>Publisher:</strong> There are a lot of sites out there that are reputable and some where you'll need to use your best judgement. 
    <small>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="http://ruby-doc.org" title="">ruby-doc.org</a></strong>: While the Ruby Docs are trusted, they can be somewhat difficult for beginners to navigate and understand</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org" title="">developer.mozilla.org</a></strong>: Considered some of the best information for HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://git-scm.com" title="">git-scm.com</a>, <a href="http://help.github.com" title="">help.github.com</a></strong>: Both Git and Github's official documentation</li>
      <li><strong>Official site for a specific tool or language</strong>: Good place to start if you have a question related to a library or framework</li>
      <li><strong>Stack Overflow</strong>: Stack Overflow is one of my personal favorite resources for getting unstuck; however, make sure to check that the question is actually the <strong>same question</strong> that you're asking, the answer is not <strong>outdated</strong>, and that the answer is <strong>upvoted</strong> multiple times. In addition, read the comments below the top answer to see if there is any new information or different scenarios that might fit your issue better.</li>
      <li><strong>W3 Schools</strong>: Generally considered behind-the-time and is unfortunately often the first result that appears when you search for front-end questions</li>
      <li><strong>Blog Posts</strong>: As a beginner (and even now!), I found a lot of answers through blog posts and tutorials. Again, watch the <strong>date</strong> on these posts and understand that these posts may or may not reflect best practices. </li>
      <li><strong>Videos</strong>: Video walk-throughs and tutorials are usually pretty great, but they can be time consuming if you're looing for a quick answer. Again, check the date of the post.</li>
    </ul>
    </small>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Question vs. Answer</strong>: If you're on a posting site, be sure that you read through the question, but look at <strong>code from the answer</strong>. Generally code from questions is incorrect.</li> 
</ol>

## BREAK

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body. 

<a name="datatypes"></a>
## Basic Data Types 

In most programming languages, you'll find the same basic <span class="vocab">data types</span>. A data type represents the kind of data that you can use in the programming language. In this section, we'll discuss five different basic data types that are applicable to both the front end and back end. 

#### Strings

Use your Googling skills to figure out <strong>what <span class="vocab">strings</span> are used for in programming</strong> and jot down your notes in the box below.

<textarea rows="4"></textarea>

<div class="toggle-show">
  Done? Click here to reveal.
  <div class="hidden">  
    <p> A <span class="vocab">string</span> is a data type used in programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers. For example, the word "hamburger" and the phrase "I ate 3 hamburgers" are both strings. Even "12345" could be considered a string, if specified correctly. Typically, programmers must enclose strings in quotation marks for the data to recognized as a string and not a number or variable name.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Strings in a Grocery Shopping App</h2>
  <p>Imagine that you're making a grocery shopping application. What sorts of data would you use strings for?</p>
  <p> Here's one example to get you started: the name of the store would be a string.</p>
  <textarea rows="4"></textarea>
</div>


#### Integers and Floats

Use your Googling skills to figure out <strong>what <span class="vocab">integers</span> and <span class="vocab">floats</span> are used for in programming</strong> and jot down your notes in the box below.

<textarea rows="2">Integers: </textarea>
<textarea rows="2">Floats: </textarea>

<div class="toggle-show">
  Done? Click here to reveal.
  <div class="hidden">
    <p><strong><span class="vocab">Integer</span>:</strong> An integer is a whole number (not a fraction) that can be positive, negative, or zero. Therefore, the numbers 10, 0, -25, and 5,148 are all integers. Unlike floating point numbers, integers cannot have decimal places.</p>
    <p><strong><span class="vocab">Float</span>:</strong> As the name implies, floating point numbers are numbers that contain floating decimal points. For example, the numbers 5.5, 0.001, and -2,345.6789 are floating point numbers. Numbers that do not have decimal places are called integers.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Integers and Floats in a Grocery Shopping App</h2>
  <p>Think back to your shopping application. What sorts of data would be stored as an integer? What about a float?</p>
  <textarea rows="4"></textarea>
</div>

#### Booleans

Use your Googling skills to figure out <strong>what a <span class="vocab">boolean</span> value is used for in programming</strong> and jot down your notes in the box below.

<textarea rows="4"></textarea>

<div class="toggle-show">
  Done? Click here to reveal.
  <div class="hidden">
    <p>Boolean, or boolean logic, is a subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements. Boolean expressions use the operators AND, OR, and NOT to compare values and return a true or false result. These boolean operators are described in the following four examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>x AND y - returns True if both x and y are true; returns False if either x or y are false.</li>
      <li>x OR y - returns True if either x or y, or both x and y are true; returns False only if x and y are both false.</li>
      <li>NOT x - returns True if x is false (or null); returns False if x is true.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="try-it">

  <p>Why might you use a boolean in a shopping application?</p>
  <p> Here's one example: Whether a specific store is open</p>
  <textarea rows="4"></textarea>
</div>

#### Arrays

Use your Googling skills to figure out <strong>what an <span class="vocab">array</span> is used for in programming</strong> and jot down your notes in the box below.

<textarea rows="4"></textarea>

<div class="toggle-show">
  Done? Click here to reveal.
  <div class="hidden">
    <p>An <span class="vocab">array</span> is a data structure that contains a group of elements.</p> 
    <p>You can think of an array as a box or container. Instead of saying "I have a box full of shirts," you could say "I have an array of shirts." The phrase "a container of pencils" would become "an array of pencils."</p>
    <p>Typically, elements in an array are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string. Arrays are commonly used in computer programs to organize data so that a related set of values can be easily sorted or searched. For example, a search engine may use an array to store Web pages found in a search performed by the user. When displaying the results, the program will output one element of the array at a time. This may be done for a specified number of values or until all the values stored in the array have been output. While the program could create a new variable for each result found, storing the results in an array is much more efficient way to manage memory.</p>
    <p>An example of an array of <strong>integers: </strong><code>[76, 3, 45958, 329, 40, 3002]</code></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Arrays in a Grocery Shopping App</h2>
  <p>What might you want to store in an array in your shopping app?</p>
  <p> Here's one example: past purchases</p>
  <textarea rows="4"></textarea>
</div>

#### Hashes or Objects

If you're in the front end program, we're going to call the next data type an <span class="vocab">object</span>. If you're in the back end program, we're going to call it a <span class="vocab">hash</span>. Use your Googling skills to search for <strong>what it is used for in programming</strong> and jot down your notes in the box below.

<textarea rows="4"></textarea>

<div class="toggle-show">
  Done? Click here to reveal.
  <div class="hidden">
    <p>A <span class="vocab">hash</span> or <span class="vocab">object</span> is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.</p>
    <p>Example with <strong>strings</strong> as both the key and value:<code>{ "key": "value" }</code></p>
    <p>Example with <strong>string</strong> as key and <strong>integer</strong> as value: <code>{ "student_count": 22 }</code></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="try-it">
  <h2>Try It: Hashes or Objects in a Grocery Shopping App</h2>
  <p>What might you want to store in a key-value format in your shopping app?</p>
  <p> Here's one example: employee counts per department (use keys for the departments in the store, use the values for the number of employees in each department)</p>
  <textarea rows="4"></textarea>
</div>

#### Syntax for Data Types

We will give you two examples of the syntax (one random example and one based on the grocery store examples) for each data type. Luckily for us, the syntax for these basic data typs is almost identical in Ruby and JavaScript. 

<div class="try-it">

#### Iteration Syntax

We'll go into breakout rooms to briefly discuss the syntax for iterating in Ruby and JavaScript. 

<div>
  Are you a <button class="iteration-toggle" id="fe-show">front end</button> or <button class="iteration-toggle" id="be-show">back end</button> student?
  <div class="hidden fe-iteration">
    <p>The code that you see below is written using JavaScript. This syntax is something that you'll see all over the place, so it's important to get used to it. You don't need to memorize every little symbol for now, but knowing how to explain the big pieces is important.</p>
    <h4>Example #1: Grading papers for five students</h4>
    <pre>var students = ['Megan', 'Jose', 'Xavier', 'Ali', 'Miriam'];

for (i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
  console.log('Grading paper for: ' + students[i]);
};</pre>
    <h4>Example #2: Multiplying By Six</h4>
    <pre>var numbers = [7, 18, 23, 38, 41, 57, 65];

for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log('The answer is: ' + numbers[i] * 6);
};</pre>
    <div class="try-it">

## The End!

After this Zoom call is over, take 15 minutes on your own to digest the content from this lesson, including the notes you wrote in the text boxes. 

In your notebook, jot down your thoughts: 

- What do I understand from today?
- When will I need what I just learned? 
- What questions do I still have? 
- What processes/behaviors did I exercise today?
