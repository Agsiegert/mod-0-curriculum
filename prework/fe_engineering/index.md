### Technical Pre-work

The technical pre-work can be completed in 8 days, with one day for setup. However, it is highly recommended that you begin  immediately. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This pre-work is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the pre-work, you should be able to do the following:

*   Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
*   Develop a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in order to build a simple, static web page (for show and tell in week 1!)

If you have more than 7 days to work on the pre-work, you should break up the work and complete the Next Steps section below so that you are coding every day!

#### What You'll Need

Items you need to complete the mod 1 pre-work:
