## Git Review

We'll start by repeating the group git exercise from Tuesday's session. This may seem repetative, but each time you practice, you'll gain muscle memory and procedural understanding.

Today's <span class="vocab">driver</span> will be the person who was born closest to the state of Maine. Everyone else will be <span class="vocab">navigators</span>. **Driver**: remember not to type anything that has not yet been brought up by a navigator and discussed in the group. 

The driver will be the person typing the commands, but the navigators should be the ones who brainstorm what comes next or what to type. In addition to naming the steps, discuss **why** you are doing each step, or **what** exactly is taking place in each step.

**Remember:** If you feel comfortable with git, your job is to hone your explanation and communication skills. Many companies in the industry that place far more weight on these professional skills than on being a technical superstar. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Git Review</h3>
  <p>As you and your group walk through the git review below, it might be a good idea to have <a href="/session3#init" title="">Session 3's Git Notes</a> open.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Before we do this, make sure the driver is <strong>outside</strong> of any previous directories where they have practiced git.</li>
    <li>Create a new directory called <code>session_4_git_practice</code>. Inside of that directory, create a file called <code>coding_languages.txt</code>.</li>
    <li>Tell git to start watching the <code>session_4_git_practice</code> directory.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Add <code>coding_languages.txt</code> to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Make your first commit in this directory.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Use the echo command to add the names of two separate coding languages to <code>coding_languages.txt</code>. You may Google "programming languages" if you can't think of any.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Before you check the difference between your last commit and what the file looks like now, predict what it will say. Then, check the diff.</li>
    <li>Add the changes to the staging area.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Commit the changes using a properly formatted commit message.</li>
    <li>Before you check the status, predict what it will say. Then, check the current status.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 8-14 again, adding the names of two new coding languages.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Finished before time is up? Repeat, but choose a different driver this time.</strong></p>

## GitHub

Git is not the same as GitHub. They work together, but they are separate tools. Git allows us to track versions of our work on our local computers. <span class="vocab">GitHub</span> is an online git repository hosting service. Other alternatives to GitHub include GitLab and BitBucket, among others.

GitHub also makes it easy for teams that use git to collaborate on the same codebase. During Mod 0, we will not be exploring the collabortive functionality of GitHub. We're going to stick to learning the basic functionality of GitHub. 

Let's first discuss this diagram:

![Github Diagram](http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/lessons/git/github-diagrams.002.jpeg)

<small><em>Source: http://frontend.turing.io/assets/images/lessons/git/github-diagrams.002.jpeg</em></small>

<span class="vocab">origin</span>: refers to where the code is hosted on GitHub. Each repository has its own origin.

<span class="vocab">git pull</span>: means download all of the changes on GitHub that I don't currently have on my local copy. You would use git pull after a teammate makes a change to the code, and you want to bring those changes into your own code.

<span class="vocab">git push</span>: this is how you share the changes you made to your local repository on GitHub.

And this one, which shows how GitHub can be used as a collaboration tool:

![Collaborative Github Diagram](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a161bdd97e4e0de40d999ac222fe2008.webp)

<small><em>Source: https://www.quora.com/What-is-git-and-repository</em></small>

A <span class="vocab">repository</span> (or <span class="vocab">repo</span>) is, at it's core, a place where your work is stored. On your local machine, that repo is the `.git` folder that we discussed last session.

Let's take a look at an example of a repo on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp" title="">FreeCodeCamp</a>

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Exploring GitHub Repositories</h3>
  <p>In your breakout group, choose one of the repositories listed at the bottom of this "Try It" section. Take a few minutes to explore the following questions and be ready to report back to your group:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What is this project about?</li>
    <li>How many commits have been made in the repository?</li>
    <li>When was the most recent commit made?</li>
    <li>About how often are changes made to this repository? How do you know?</li>
    <li>Who is the top contributor?</li>
    <li>How many people have contributed to the repository?</li>
    <li>How many people are watching the repository?</li>
    <li>How many issues are open? Can you decipher what problems any of the issues are reporting? Is there any discussion happening on the issues?</li>
    <li>How many open pull requests exist? What was the date of the most recent pull request?</li>
    <li>Is there active commenting on the pull requests? Can you decipher what people are discussing?</li>
    <li>What other things do you see on the repository? Can you google these things to find out what they are?</li>
    <li>Done before time is up? Pick a second repository to explore.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Options:</p>

### Creating a Remote Repo on GitHub

Watch and take notes while we walk through how to add a remote to your local repository. 

1. Click the plus button in the upper right-hand corner of GitHub and select "New Repository". 
1. Give your repository a name, but keep all other settings the same for now.
1. Click "Create Repository"
1. Scroll to `â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line`
1. Paste the lines listed, one at a time, in your terminal. 
1. Refresh Github. Tada! Your project is there. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Adding a Remote</h3>
  <p>1. Create a new repository on GitHub called <code>git_homework</code>.</p>
  <p>2. In your terminal, navigate to your <code>git_homework</code> directory from session 3's homework.</p>
  <p>3. Add the remote to your local repository, then push your changes to GitHub.</p>
</div>

### Making Additional Changes and Pushing to GitHub

Open up either Sublime or Atom. Use the keyboard shortcut `command + o` to search for your `git_practice` project.

Watch and take notes while we walk through how to continue making changes and pushing those changes to GitHub.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Full Git Workflow</h3>
  <p>In your breakout rooms, <strong>everyone</strong> will complete the steps below synchronously, but on your own projects. Use each other as resources and sounding boards. Don't hesitate to click "share screen" if there's something you want your team to look at!</p>
  <p>If you get really stuck, you can click "ask for help" and we'll pop into your room.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a few new quotes to your <code>quotes.txt</code> file.</li>
    <li>Save your file using the shortcut <code>command + s</code>.</li>
    <li>Go back to your terminal.</li>
    <li>Use commands to add and commit your new changes. Be sure to use <code>git status</code> to check your status, and make sure your commit message is properly formatted.</li>
    <li>Push your new changes to GitHub.</li>
    <li>Refresh the page to make sure the new changes appear.</li>
    <li>Repeat the above steps, but this time, remove one of the quotes from your <code>quotes.txt</code> document, then add, commit, and push your changes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Done? Paste the link to your GitHub repo into the breakout room chat, then check the commits in each other's GitHub repos.</p>
  <p>Done with that? Get to know your breakout room classmates better: What are they trying to get better at in life? What book would the recommend that everyone read at least once in life?</p>

## BREAK

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body.

## Forking vs. Cloning

#### What is Cloning?

When you <span class="vocab">clone</span> a repository from GitHub, you are downloading the code that lives at that specific web address. You can clone a repo that belongs to you, or you can clone anyone else's public repository. For example, you could clone any of the repositories that you looked at in your breakout groups. 

To clone a project, click the green "Clone or download" button and copy the web address. In your terminal, type:

```
git clone <paste web address>
```

If you clone a repository that you own **OR** you are a collaborator, you will be able to push new changes to that repository, like so:
![pushed changes to a repository on GitHub](images/success.gif)

If you do have access to push changes, you can do so with this command:

```
git push origin master
```

If you clone a repo that does not belong to you, and you are not listed as a collaborator, you will be blocked when you try to push changes to the default remote, as seen below: 

![denied permission to push to remote repo](images/denied.gif)

#### When might you use cloning?

- You are working with a team and everyone is added as a collaborator on the project repository. Everyone will be pushing their code up to the same repository.
- Your instructor has an example repo that they are using for a code-along lesson. You will not need to turn anything in. After the lesson, you will not need the codebase again, or if you do, you will only need to access your downloaded copy on your computer. 
- Anytime you don't need an existing project to have a reference to the original project.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Cloning</h3>
  <p>1. Clone down one of the repositories that we looked at in breakout groups earlier.</p>
  <p>2. Remove the readme file, add, commit the changes, and try pushing your changes to the origin.</p>
</div>

#### What is Forking?

Forking is a type of cloning on GitHub, but it will keep a reference to the original, existing project. To fork an existing project, you just click the `fork` button, which will make a copy of all of the code and directory structure to your own GitHub account. 

You can tell if something is a fork because it will say "forked from [original repo name]" underneath the title.

Once you've forked a repo, you will **follow the exact same steps** that we saw above to get the repo on your local machine:

```
git clone <insert address here>
```

If you fork, clone, make changes, and push to origin, it will work because it's pushing to **your forked origin** (which you own), not the original repository (which you don't own). To push those changes:

```
git push origin master
```

![forking and cloning](images/forkpush.gif)

#### When might you use forking?

- You are working on a project and your instructor has already created a "starter kit". Your job is to finish building out the project and submit it.
- You find a typo in the code for an external library you are using. You want to fix it and submit your changes for the library maintainer to review.
- You want to build off of an existing codebase. You do not intend to merge your changes back into the original codebase, but you do want to give credit to the original team.

<div class="try-it">
