All of the homework for mod 0 can be found on the [mod 0 project board](https://github.com/turingschool/mod-0/projects/1)


You'll be using an app called [conveyor belt](http://conveyorbelt.herokuapp.com/) to create your own copy of the board above. This will allow you to track your progress on the homework over time by moving each card to the done column when you've completed it.

This project board allows for a methodology called kanban (I would google the term if you're unfamiliar) to organize and update

* The original board is located at `https://github.com/turingschool/mod-0/projects/1`
* After going through conveyorbelt, your copy will be found at `https://github.com/<yourusername>/mod-0/projects/1`
  * For example, since my github username is `damwhit`, my board would be at `https://github.com/damwhit/mod-0/projects/1`

When you've finished your homework for a given session, and you're looking for something to do, you can always rely on the mod 1 pre-work as that outlet! Just find the link in the sidebar for your program.
