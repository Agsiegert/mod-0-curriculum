All of the homework for mod 0 can be found on the [mod 0 project board](https://github.com/turingschool/mod-0/projects/1)

This project board uses a methodology called kanban (I would google the term if you're unfamiliar)

You'll be using an app called [conveyor belt](http://conveyorbelt.herokuapp.com/) to create your own copy of the board above. This will allow you to track your progress on the homework over time by moving each card to the done column when you've completed it.

When you've finished your homework, and you're looking for something to do, you can always rely on the mod 1 pre-work as that outlet! Just find the link in the sidebar for your program.
