### Creating your hw board

All of the mod 0 work is organized on a [mod 0 trello board](https://trello.com/b/fMthLx4x/mod-0)

This board allows for a methodology called kanban (I would google the term if you're unfamiliar) to organize and update you tasks

When you've finished your homework for a given session, and you're looking for something to do, you can always rely on the mod 1 pre-work as that outlet! Just find the link in the sidebar for your program.
