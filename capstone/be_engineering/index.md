In order to make you as successful as possible during your time here, we have collected readings and exercises for you to complete prior to beginning Mod 1. This capstone helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their time at Turing.

## Capstone Overview

The Mod 0 Capstone is divided into two sections: Professional Development and Technical. You are required to spend at least 8 days completing these assignments, however it is recommended that you start as soon as possible. If you have more than a week to dedicate to the capstone, make sure you continue to code every day after you have completed the assignments. You SHOULD NOT complete the capstone early and take an extended break from coding before your first day of class. This is very important to make sure you are in a routine that will keep your skills sharp and prepare you to hit the ground running on day 1.

## Capstone Assignments

The following assignments are due **according to the date on turing.io/prep**. You will submit links to your work there using a google form.

### Professional Development

Turing is not just a school where you learn to code. Turing's curriculum focuses on both technical and professional development.

In order to achieve our mission and vision, we also have group sessions each week called Gear Up in order to bring community awareness to certain issues in the tech industry.

The assignments below will be submitted in gists that you will create on your GitHub account. A gist is a text document that can be stored on GitHub. To create a gist, follow the steps below:

* Log in to your GitHub account
* In the upper right corner, click on the '+' icon
* Select 'New Gist'
* Enter a filename, with the extension .md
* Enter the text of your gist in the large text area
* click Create Public Gist
* You can also visit [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/)

### Technical Capstone

The technical capstone can be completed in 8 days, with one day for setup. However, it is highly recommended that you begin  immediately. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This capstone is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the capstone, you should be able to do the following:

* Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
* Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple program (for show and tell)

If you have more than 7 days to work on the capstone, you should break up the work and complete the Next Steps section below so that you are coding every day!

The link below will take you to the Github page that contains all the Technical work. Scroll through the page to find the instructions for getting your computer setup and getting started.

### Next Steps

Before moving any further, complete all of the projects listed in Day 7 of the Module 0 Capstone Repository.
