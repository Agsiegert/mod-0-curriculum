### Technical Capstone

The technical capstone can be completed in 8 days, with one day for setup. However, it is highly recommended that you begin  immediately. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This capstone is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the capstone, you should be able to do the following:

* Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
* Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple program (for show and tell)

If you have more than 7 days to work on the capstone, you should break up the work and complete the Next Steps section below so that you are coding every day!

The link below will take you to the Github page that contains all the Technical work. Scroll through the page to find the instructions for getting your computer setup and getting started.

### Next Steps

Before moving any further, complete all of the projects listed in Day 7 of the Module 0 Capstone Repository.

If you have more time, review the [Back End Curriculum Site](http://backend.turing.io/) for additional resources.


### What is Front-End Development?

Front-end development deals with the user facing elements of a website, or the part of the website or software that you interact with. It's the meeting point of design and development, and requires developers to be skilled at writing a blend of HTML (page structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity). Using UX/UI principles, expert understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, front-end developers are a critical part of modern software engineering teams.

### Learning Goals

The mod 0 capstone is organized across seven days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort to complete the tasks for each day - so about 30-35 hours total. Goals of the mod 0 capstone:

*   Establish a routine of coding every day
*   Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
*   Understand what pieces make up a web application
*   Become familiar with some common terminology used in web development
*   Develop a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in order to build a simple, static web page (for show and tell!)

If you have more than seven days (or more than 30-35 hours) to dedicate to the mod 0 capstone, first complete the 7-day mod 0 capstone tasks, and then continue to the [month-long mod 0 capstone section](#month) that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to serve as a deeper dive.

Remember, don't worry if you don't understand 100% of everything. Let's get started!

### What You'll Need

Items you need to complete the mod 0 capstone:

*   A computer - preferably a laptop running Mac OSX that is a 2013 model or newer. If you have a Windows, Linux PC or an older Mac, then go ahead and still do this mod 0 capstone!
*   Purchase the books: [Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1541193719&sr=8-2&keywords=duckett)
*   A consistent internet connection

### Daily Warm Up

Practice makes perfect, and this daily task will help build on your typing skills. Spend 20 minutes total on this every-day task.

*   #### [typing.io](https://typing.io/)
    
    Aim for 25 wpm without looking at the keyboard. Focus on JavaScript and jQuery. You would be surprised how many common programming keyboard characters you're not used to typing.

### Technical Capstone

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of the mod 0 capstone is designed to get you into that essential routine before the first day of class.

Even if you plan to spend 14 days on this 7-day mod 0 capstone, you should break up the work so that you are doing work and coding every day, even if it is only a little.
