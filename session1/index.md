## Turing Mission and Expectations

> “Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.”

### Growth Mindset

Turing is a very challenging experience for most people. In order to be successful I'd highly recommend that you embrace a **growth mindset**. This means that you believe that knowledge and intelligence can be improved through hard work and dedication, and that you may fail at something before you're successful at it.

### Communication

Make sure that you've added the [Mod 0 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Y2FzaW1pcmNyZWF0aXZlLmNvbV8xMnA0NjkzaG1lcjFvcmNlcHA3NHZnNzdwZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to your own calendar. This is where you will find all mod 0 related events, including sessions, capstone study sessions, and other community wide events.

Joanne will also remind you when these events are via **[slack](https://turingschool.slack.com/)**, which is the primary mode of communication we use at Turing. Make sure that you're checking it once a day so that you can stay up to date.

## Mod 0 Expecations

Mod 0 is less about code or solving difficult problems and more about developing and learning tools, procedures, systems, and  learning behaviors/processes. For some of you, the technical content will be brand new. For others, it will be review.

At the end of Session 5, you'll take a technical assessment that will showcase a subset skills you learn during Mod 0. The assessment will be performance-based rather than multiple choice. The assessment instructions will include a checklist of what we're looking for to know that you've practiced and mastered the material.

### Being Turing Ready

By the Monday after your last Mod 0 session you’ll be rated as one of the following: 

**Not Ready** based on any of these factors:
 * You’ve missed more than one session or did not meet engagement expectations
 * You’ve missed assignments or delivered poor quality work
 * You were unable to pass the Session 5 Technical Assessment
   * *Next step:* You have one chance to re-enroll in and successfully complete Mod 0
 * If you don’t pass on your second try you will be asked to reapply to Turing in 45 days.

**Pending**

  * Your submitted work exhibited minor problems or was submitted improperly, but you have demonstrated sufficient professionalism and expertise deserving of extra patience
	  * *Next step:* Complete your assigned makeup steps within three days and move to Ready

**Technical-Ready**
 * Your work and assessment demonstrate that you’re ready to be successful in Mod 1
   * *Next step:* Submit your Program-Specific Mod 0 Capstone

### Breakout Rooms

This is a feature in zoom that we'll use throughout the mod 0 sessions. They allow for small group discussion, where y'all can solidify concepts or work through challenges. You'll be kicked out into smaller group with 2 or 3 of your classmates. When they're finished you'll get a 60 second warning where you can rejoin the main session, or you'll automatically rejoin at the end of the 60 seconds. During these, we may broadcast messages or pop in to see how we are doing time-wise. They can be a bit awkward at first, but try to embrace them and have fun!

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Break out rooms</h3>
  <p>1. Introduce yourself (name, pronouns, program).</p>
  <p>2. Where do you call home</p>
  <p>3. What is one reason you chose to come to Turing?</p>
  <p>4. What is your biggest concern about coming to Turing?</p>
</div>

Other things to note as we go through Mod 0:

- <strong>Zoom</strong>: turn video on, turn mic off unless speaking
- <strong>Breakout Rooms</strong>: don't be afraid to speak! Breakout rooms will be randomized at the beginning of each session, but continue to rely on your accountabilabuddy groups from Session 1 between sessions
- <strong>Problems or individual questions during the Zoom session?</strong> Message the non-presenting host (either David or Tim)

<a name="studytips"></a>
### Study Habits

Throughout your time at Turing, including mod 0 we'd suggest that you get in the habit of doing the following:

#### Pre-teaching
* Preview: Up to 24 hours prior
* Check out the lesson plan 
* Peek at coding examples
* Record new vocab in Turing Notebook

#### Take great notes (during the lesson)
* Turing Notebook: Start now with handwritten notes
* Visual organization: Colors/markers/pens/stickies 
* Diagrams: Draw out everything your instructors draw on board
* KEY ideas: Focus on main concepts, write in your own words

#### Post-teaching
* Review: At lesson’s close
* What do I understand from today?
* When will I need what I just learned?
* What questions do I still have?
* Do your own research!

### Study Habits (focus)
* Limit distractions. Turn off:
  * Notifications (slack, imessage, etc)
  * Phone (or airplane mode, and out of sight)

* Location, location, location:
  * Make sure that your space is quiet and free from distractions
  * Leave house if need be

### Study Habits (goals)
* Study/Worktime goal:
  * Write a priority in your notebook. 
  * Update priorities with each study/work session (get granular)
  * Use checklists and kanban tracking
* Pomodoros:
  * Use a TIMER and stick to it. (befocused timer - free on App Store)
  * Plan for focus and recovery (you’ll get more done!)

## BREAK

Turn off your mics and videos and walk away from the computer. Stand up, stretch, drink water. Do a few sit-ups, squats, push-ups, jumping jacks, arm circles, stress ball squeezes, or whatever else moves your body.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Most computer users rely heavily on the mouse to open applications, interact with programs, etc. You might think that you're quick with a mouse, but just wait until you get good at <span class="vocab">keyboard shortcuts</span>. 

Initially, your flow will be slower as you learn and memorize each of the shortcuts. However, if you force yourself to use these shortcuts, you'll become MUCH faster in the long run.

## Classes

### Defining and Identifying Classes

**Note**: This is a topic that we will revisit in bite-size chunks leading up to Session 5. We will not talk about the technical aspects of how classes play a part in programming today; instead, we will apply the terminology and concepts to real life.

Think of a <span class="vocab">class</span> as a category of thing. For example, deep dish, new york, and pan (instances) are all different versions of a **pizza** (class). 

An Old Navy sweatshirt and an Eddie Bauer sweatshirt (instances) are different versions of a **sweatshirt** (class).

_Great Expectations_ by Charles Dickens and _Becomming_ by Michelle Obama (instances) are different versions of a **book** (class). 

Class names are always singular: **pizza** (instead of pizzas), **sweatshirt** (instead of sweatshirts), and **book** instead of books. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Classes</h3>
  <p>Post two sentences in the chat using this structure:</p>
  <p>______, ________, and _______ (instances) are different versions of a ________ (class).</p>
</div>

### Attributes of Classes

An <span class="vocab">attribute</span> of a class is a characteristic that every instance of that class has.

For example: 

- Each **pizza** (class) has a crust, sauce, and toppings (attributes).
- Each **sweatshirt** (class) has a color, size, brand, and price (attributes).
- Each **book** (class) has a title, author, publisher, published_date, and total_pages (attributes). 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Attributes</h3>
  <p>Post two sentences in the chat about your two classes using this structure:</p>
  <p>Each _______ (class) has a _______, ________, and ________ (attributes).</p>
</div>

<a name="findinganswers"></a>
## Googling

Believe it or not, a good chunk of your time as a programmer will be spent Googling to find answers to your questions. In fact, a somewhat experienced programmer will Google at a much higher rate than a beginning programmer. Therefore, it's really important to get good at Googling. 

For a frame of reference so that you know just how often we rely on Google (even the "easy" stuff), this is my most recent Chrome history as I've been building this curriculum 😂

<img style="width: 50%" src="images/rachel_history.png" alt="Rachel's search history">

When I Google programming questions, I _usually_ include three things (in varying orders): 

<ol>
  <li>What I want to do (verb)</li>
  <li>to what thing (noun)</li>
  <li>using what language or tool</li>
</ol>

For example, if I wanted to add a thick green border to a heading on my webpage and I'm using plain CSS for styling, I might google this:

```
how to add border to heading css
```

or

```
make border on heading element css
```
<strong>SUPER IMPORTANT:</strong> You might not get the results you're looking for on the first go-around.

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Try It: Writing Google-able Phrases</h3>
  <p>Write out Google-able search phrases for each of the following scenarios. Do not get hung up on being unfamiliar with the terminology for each scenario. We just want phrases to put into Google.</p>
  <p>1. I am using Git for version control and made a typo in a commit message. I need to change it before I push my changes to GitHub.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2: 
  </textarea>
  <p>2. I got this error message when I ran my Ruby program and I don't know what it means or how to fix it: <em>"unterminated string meets end of file"</em></p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2: 
  </textarea>
  <p>3. A Mod 0 homework assignment asks you to print out your git log in oneline (yes, oneline, not a spelling error) format and David definitely did not teach how to do this during class.</p>
  <textarea rows="2">
    Phrase 1: 
    Phrase 2: 
  </textarea>
</div>

### Sifting Through Results

Once you formulate a good Google search and receive your results, there are a few things you'll want to consider when determining which results to open. 

<div class="try-it">
  <h3>Demo: Google Results</h3>
  <p>We'll look through some Google results for "change width of textarea in html". Be ready to jot down tips for sifting through results.</p>
</div>

## The End!

After this Zoom call is over, take 15 minutes on your own to digest the content from this lesson, including the notes you wrote in the text boxes. 

In addition, consider the following questions:
  - What do I understand from today?
  - When will I need what I just learned? 
  - What questions do I still have? 
  - What learning processes/behaviors did I exercise today?
